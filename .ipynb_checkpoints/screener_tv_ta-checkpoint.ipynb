    "# Building an Effective Trading Screener with Python and Tradingview\n",
    "\n",
    "Trading screeners are indispensable tools for traders and investors seeking opportunities in the vast financial markets. By applying specific criteria and indicators to filter through a multitude of instruments, we can uncover potential trades with higher probabilities of success.\n",
    "\n",
    "To accomplish this, we will leverage the `tradingview_ta` library, a powerful Python library that provides access to a wide range of updated and popular indicators used by traders worldwide. This ensures that we stay ahead of the game by incorporating the latest market insights into our screening process. We'll also utilize the `yfinance` library to effortlessly download historical quotes for our selected instruments. This enables us to have a solid foundation of historical data for comprehensive analysis and testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this article, we will focus on a practical application using Argentine ADRs (American Depositary Receipts). However, it's important to note that the principles and techniques we explore can be applied to a wide range of instruments available on Tradingview. Whether you're interested in stocks, futures, ETFs, cryptocurrencies, or any other tradable asset, this screener can adapt to your needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first part we create a graph where we can visually see how many technical indicators give purchase or sale for each of the analyzed actions. Then, in a second section, we download the detail of each of the technical indicators to filter and search for trading opportunities in specific assets."

    "If an exception occurs during the retrieval process, indicating that no data is found for the ticker on the NYSE, we handle the exception and search for the data on the NASDAQ (NASDAQ Stock Market), which is another popular U.S. stock exchange.\n",

    "### Section 2: Unveiling Trading Opportunities through Indicator Filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "While the collective signals offer a broad perspective, our approach goes beyond surface-level analysis. In the second section, we leverage the power of technical indicators by diving deeper into their individual details. We download and analyze the specific data points for each indicator, enabling us to apply advanced filtering techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first step, we involve importing technical indicator data for a list of stock tickers from either the NYSE or NASDAQ exchange and storing it in a pandas DataFrame called df_adrs_indicators. The code iterates over each ticker, attempts to retrieve the indicator data from the NYSE, and if it fails, searches for the data in the NASDAQ. The retrieved data is then concatenated with the existing DataFrame. Finally, the column names are converted to strings, and a success message is printed. This process allows for the consolidation of technical indicator data for multiple stocks, enabling further analysis and identification of trading opportunities."
